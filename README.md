# lizard_ml 🦎

This repository contains my implementations, experiments, and solutions based on the "Machine Learning Handbook" (the famous "Lizard Book" by Aurélien Géron).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to master Machine Learning through hands-on practice. It includes:
* **Code Walkthroughs:** Re-implementing the examples and pipelines discussed in each chapter.
* **Exercise Solutions:** My personal solutions to the end-of-chapter challenges.
* **Experiments:** Testing the limits of Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow on custom datasets.
